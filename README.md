# darringer-games-chess-model

This project contains the model and control logic for a chess engine 
that uses a "min-max" search algorithm with alpha beta pruning to achieve 
decent search depths.  At the moment the chess engine can search around 
550k states per second and can solve mate-in-3 problems without too much 
trouble.  This is the initial version, however, so there is plenty of 
room for improvement and a variety of optimizations are being planned.
